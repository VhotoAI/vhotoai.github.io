      faces in photos and camera experiences. We may detect and use facial marks to

      Services may utilize calculation results of certain AR technologies in

      effect and perform&nbsp;feature analysis using the algorithm.&nbsp;The

      recommendation is finished&nbsp;or upon the closing of the application  or  website, the
      facial mapping&nbsp;information is discarded. This&nbsp;information is not
      shared with any third parties.&nbsp;

    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We will only collect and process personal information where we have lawful
      bases and we typically rely on one of the following four legal bases: -
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>consent(where you have given consent);</li>
      <li>
        contract (where processing is necessary for the performance of a contract
        with you, for example, to operate the site or deliver any services you have
        requested);
      </li>
      <li>
        legitimate interests (for example we need to use your information to provide
        and improve our Services, including protecting your account, providing
        customer support). We rely on our legitimate interests as our lawful basis
        only where those interests are not overridden by the impact on you (unless
        we have your consent or our processing is otherwise required or permitted by
        law); and
      </li>
      <li>
        legal obligations (to comply with the laws, rules and regulations or
        requests by government departments, judicial authorities or law
        enforcement).
      </li>
    </ul>

              As a data subject, you have a right to obtain access and information under the
              conditions provided in Art.&nbsp;15 GDPR.
            </p>
            <p>
              This means in particular that you have the right to obtain confirmation from
              us as to whether we are processing your personal data. If so, you also have
              the right to obtain access to the personal data and the information listed in
              Art.&nbsp;15 (1) GDPR. This includes information regarding the purposes of the

              As a data subject, you have the right to rectification under the conditions

            </p>
            <p>
              This means in particular that you have the right to receive from us without

              completion of incomplete personal data.

              As a data subject, you have a right to erasure (&ldquo;right to be
              forgotten&rdquo;) under the conditions provided in Art.&nbsp;17 GDPR.
            </p>
            <p>
              This means that you have the right to obtain from us the erasure of your
              personal data and we are obliged to erase your personal data without undue
              delay when one of the reasons listed in Art.&nbsp;17&nbsp;(1) GDPR applies.
              This can be the case, for example, if personal data are no longer necessary in
              relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed
              (Art.&nbsp;17&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;(a) GDPR).
            </p>
            <p>
              If we have made the personal data public and are obliged to erase it, we are
              also obliged, taking account of available technology and the cost of
              implementation, to take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to
              inform controllers which are processing the personal data that you have
              requested the erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or
              replication of those personal data (Art.&nbsp;17&nbsp;(2) GDPR).

              The right to erasure (&ldquo;right to be forgotten&rdquo;) does not apply if
              the processing is necessary for one of the reasons listed in
              Art.&nbsp;17&nbsp;(3) GDPR. This can be the case, for example, if the
              processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation or for the
              establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims
              (Art.&nbsp;17&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;(b) and (e) GDPR).
            </p>
            <p>
              You can find the full extent of your right to erasure (&ldquo;right to be

              As a data subject, you have a right to restriction of processing under the
              conditions provided in Art.&nbsp;18 GDPR.
            </p>
            <p>
              This means that you have the right to obtain from us the restriction of
              processing if one of the conditions provided in Art.&nbsp;18&nbsp;(1) GDPR
              applies. This can be the case, for example, if you contest the accuracy of the
              personal data. In such a case, the restriction of processing lasts for a
              period that enables us to verify the accuracy of the personal data
              (Art.&nbsp;18&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;(a) GDPR).
            </p>
            <p>
              Restriction means that stored personal data are marked with the goal of
              restricting their future processing (Art.&nbsp;4&nbsp;(3) GDPR).
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>
              This means that you generally have the right to receive your personal data
              with which you have provided us in a structured, commonly used and
              machine-readable format and to transmit those data to another controller
              without hindrance from us if the processing is based on consent pursuant to

              contract pursuant to Art.&nbsp;6&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;(b) GDPR and the processing is
              carried out by automated means (Art.&nbsp;20&nbsp;(1) GDPR).
            </p>
            <p>
              You can find information as to whether an instance of processing is based on
              consent pursuant to Art.&nbsp;6&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;(a) or
              Art.&nbsp;9&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;(a) GDPR or on a contract pursuant to

            <p>
              In exercising your right to data portability, you also generally have the
              right to have your personal data transmitted directly from us to another
              controller if technically feasible (Art.&nbsp;20&nbsp;(2) GDPR).
